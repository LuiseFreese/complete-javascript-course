    <p>Taylor alison swift(born December 13, 1989) is an American
      singer-songwriter. Her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by
      her personal experiences, has received widespread media coverage and
      critical praise. Based in Nashville, Tennessee, Swift signed with Sony/ATV
      Tree Publishing in 2004 to become a songwriter and with Big Machine
      Records in 2005 to become a country music singer. Her eponymous debut
      studio album (2006) included the Hot Country Songs number-one singles "Our
      Song" and "Should've Said No" and the pop radio crossover "Teardrops on My
      Guitar". Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her country pop second
      studio album, Fearless (2008), which was certified Diamond by the
      Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and featured the top-five
      singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me". Her third studio album,
      Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with rock elements and furthered her
      crossover success with the top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December".
      Swift's fourth studio album, Red (2012), experimented beyond country,
      incorporating pop, rock, and electronic genres. She completely
      transitioned to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014);
      its successor, Reputation (2017), expanded on the electropop sound with
      urban influences. Swift released her next studio album, Lover, in 2019,
      while she was in a dispute over the ownership of her back catalog after
      her Big Machine contract expired. She explored indie folk and alternative
      rock on her 2020 studio albums, Folklore and Evermore. These six albums
      spawned a string of international top-ten singles, including "We Are Never
      Ever Getting Back Together", "I Knew You Were Trouble", "Shake It Off",
      "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", "Look What You Made Me Do", "Me!", "You Need
      to Calm Down", "Cardigan", and "Willow". She also released the acclaimed
      documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions
      in 2020. Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with
      over 200 million records sold worldwide. Her accolades include 11 Grammy
      Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), a Primetime Creative Arts
      Emmy Award, two Brit Awards, 11 MTV Video Music Awards (including two
      Video of the Year wins), 12 Country Music Association Awards, 25 Billboard
      Music Awards (the most wins by a woman), 32 American Music Awards (the
      most wins by an artist) and 49 Guinness World Records. She ranked eighth
      on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on
      Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has
      been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the
      100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes
      Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the
